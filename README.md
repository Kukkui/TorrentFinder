TorrentFinder
=============
TorrentFinder it's a web application with a PHP back-end that allows torrents search and downloads via an installed transmission daemon. A google-like web interface let you search for torrents, aggregating results from different torrent search engines and add torrents to your transmission queue with a single click.

Torrent search is performed by parsing different websites or by using their external API. The architecture of the system has been designed to make the addition of different search engines very easy.
